# LSB-IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY
LSB (Least Significant Bit) Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret data inside an
image without visibly changing the image. It works by modifying the least significant bit of pixel
values in a digital image. Since the change happens in the smallest bit, the human eye cannot
detect the difference. In this project, the user implemented an encoder and decoder that embed
secret messages into BMP images and later extract them safely.
